Running a benchmark

**Introduction to benchmarking**

Automatminer can be used for benchmarking ML performance on materials
problems in a standardized fashion. A common example use case is comparing one
published method to another; another use is getting a rough idea how an
Automatminer model will generalize to making "real" predictions. To mitigate
unfair model advantages from biased splits or hyperparameter tuning,
Automatminer uses nested cross validation with identical
outer splits for benchmarking:

**Usage**

`MatPipe` has a `benchmark` method which can be used for automatic benchmarking.




` Matminer <https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer>`_
provides access to the MatBench benchmark suite, a curated set of 13 diverse
materials ML problems which work in Automatminer benchmarks. Learn more here:
